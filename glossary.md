# GitHub 

- **Repository**: A collection of files and folders representing a project.

- **Git**: A "distributed revision control system," used by programmers to
  manage collaborative work on projects.

- **GitHub**: A website, designed to make working with distributed revision
  control systems (like Git) easier.

- **Issue**: A note, on GitHub, with a unique number.

- **Kanban board**: A set of columns, usually representing the stages of
  progress of some work. Work is represented by issues, rather like post-it
  notes, and the issues move from one column to the next as things progress.
  
- **Project**: Highly overloaded term! Can mean: 
  - the thing that is being developed in the repository;
  - a Kanban board (GitHub's terminology);
  - something else
  
In REG, we have a special repostory (called "Hut23") which as an associated
Kanban board (which GitHub calles a "Project"), on which all of our projects are
represented as issues.
